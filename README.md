Dark Processing Theme (for 2.0)
===================

A dark theme for the Processing IDE (a little easier on the eyes!) for Processing 2.0 - for a Processing 1.5 theme, see (this repository)[].

####INSTALLATION
1. **PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine - note the only main change is setting `editor.antialias` to true, which makes your fonts look WAY better!  Note that this can also be accomplished using the Preferences menu in the IDE.
2. **THEME FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/Modes` and in the folder of the Mode you want to change (ie: Java, JavaScript, Android, etc).  Replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!)
This folder contains a 'themes.txt' file with the bulk of the changes (mostly colors)  
The new theme structure removes many of the buttons (I've left them default) but introduces a somewhat distracting banner image - it has been replaced with a clear PNG which should show any colors you choose in the theme.txt file. Otherwise, change them yourself to something more your style!
3. **SCREENSHOT**  
Self-explanatory :)
